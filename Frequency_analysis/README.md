Welcome to the **Letter Frequency Visualization** project! This project is designed to analyze and visualize the frequencies of letters in texts from different English dialects. By comparing these frequencies, i aim to explore how the letter distribution can differentiate between dialects of English. Whether you're dealing with British, American, Australian, or Irish English, letter frequency distributions offer valuable insight into regional linguistic traits.

## üåü **Project Overview**

In this project, we analyze the **letter frequencies** in four texts written in different dialects of English:

- **British English** (Dracula by Bram Stoker)
- **American English** (Short Story Classics: American Edition)
- **Irish English** (Dubliners by James Joyce)
- **Australian English** (Tales of the Bush by Henry Lawson)

By visualizing the frequency of each letter in these texts, the goal is to show how these distributions can be used to **differentiate** between English dialects. The hypothesis is that people writing in different dialects may use letters with slightly different frequencies, offering a subtle but insightful distinction between the regions.

## üîç **How It Works**

1. **Text Processing**: The program reads in texts from the provided books.
2. **Letter Frequency Calculation**: It calculates the frequency of each letter (from 'a' to 'z') in the text.
3. **Visualization**: Using **matplotlib**, the program creates bar charts to visualize the frequency distributions for each dialect.
4. **Comparison**: The visualizations highlight how letter frequencies can **differ** across British, American, Australian, and Irish dialects.

## üìö **Books Used for Analysis**

1. **Dracula by Bram Stoker** ‚Äì British English
2. **Dubliners by James Joyce** ‚Äì Irish English
3. **Short Story Classics (American) Vol. 2 by William Patten** ‚Äì American English
4. **Tales of the Bush by Henry Lawson** ‚Äì Australian English

These texts are used to perform the frequency analysis, providing insights into how different dialects can subtly influence language.

## üé® **Visualizing the Data**

The results of the analysis are presented as bar charts for each text. Each chart shows the **letter frequencies** from 'a' to 'z'. By comparing the visualizations, we can observe:

- **How different dialects use letters with varying frequencies**.
- **Which letters are more or less frequent** in each dialect.
- A **clear comparison of all dialects** in one combined graph.

## üöÄ **Goal & Impact**

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how letter frequencies can **differentiate between dialects** of English. By analyzing these differences, we gain insight into how regional variations in language influence writing patterns. This could be particularly useful for:

- **Forensic linguistics**: Identifying the regional origin of a writer.
- **Text classification**: Using letter frequency distributions to classify text by dialect.
- **Language research**: Exploring regional linguistic features.
